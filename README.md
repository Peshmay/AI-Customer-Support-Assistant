# NordicGear AI Customer Support Assistant

An AI-powered customer support chatbot that simulates a real-world e-commerce support system for an outdoor equipment store.

The assistant helps users with questions about products, shipping, returns, payments, and store policies using a structured knowledge base and controlled prompt instructions.

## Project Overview

The NordicGear Support Assistant acts as a virtual customer support agent for a fictional outdoor gear retailer.

Users can ask questions such as:

• How can I track my order?  
• Can I return a product if it doesn’t fit?  
• Does NordicGear ship internationally?  
• What gear do I need for camping?

The assistant uses a **knowledge base file (`NordicGear.md`) combined with system prompt rules** to provide structured responses while preventing hallucinated information.

## Key Features

• AI-powered customer support assistant  
• Knowledge-based responses using `NordicGear.md`  
• Prompt-controlled AI behavior to prevent hallucinations  
• Conversation context tracking using OpenAI response IDs  
• Input validation using Zod  
• Modular backend architecture (controllers, services, repositories)  
• Real-time chat interface with typing indicator  
• Markdown rendering for AI responses
